Overview
--
A Roblox Battle Royale. Once you spawn, you have 50 seconds to eliminate the opposition. Last person standing wins. Designed using lua and the Roblox game engine. The game requires 2 players to play; once spawned, each player must equip their gun by pressing 2. They then have 6
bullets before they must reload (using the shortcut "R"). It takes 3 shots to eliminate a player, but only 2 with headshots.

I have provided the main gameplay .lua files, but the game can be fully reconstructed by loading the provided .rbxl file into Roblox Studio. The full file includes the models, animations, UI elements, and mechanics not covered by the script.
